# Hangman Game in React JS
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game, built using React JS.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Installing
To run the app locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/dominika-kl/Hangman
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project: cd hangman-app
3. Install the dependencies: npm install
4. Start the development server: npm start

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

### Usage
1. The game will randomly choose a word from a list of words.
2. You can guess the letters of the word one by one.
3. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure will be drawn.
4. You have ten incorrect guesses before you lose the game.
5. If you correctly guess the word, you win!
